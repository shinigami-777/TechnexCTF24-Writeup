### Description :
I got bored and started expressing my frustration online...but I fear I may have leaked some secret..

### Solution :
The title of the chall suggests the use of [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/).
On  searching for the user 43h1, we find a [paste](https://pastebin.com/Rwjdj3ku). The paste appears to be a spammimic text. So we use [spammimic decode tool](https://www.spammimic.com/decode.shtml).
Upon decoding it gives
```text
way back we go....
```
On using wayback machine (the pastebin paste was edited) we get the [actual paste](https://web.archive.org/web/20240315072259/https://pastebin.com/Rwjdj3ku) which is another spammimic text. Upon decoding it gives
```text
say my name... say my name...or should i say username ....     10n3_w01f_13
```
On searching for user ```10n3_w01f_13``` on twitter https://twitter.com/10n3_w01f_13 was found. The account had a post(tomato soup pic lol) with a alt text with the flag
