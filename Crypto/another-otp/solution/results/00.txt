In cryptography the onetime pad OTP is an encryption technqque that cannot ze cracked but requires the use of a singleuse preshared key that is larger
than or equal to the size of the message being sent In thik technique a plaqntext is paired with a random secret key also referred to as a onetime
pad Then each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypt}d by combining il with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition
The resulting ciphertext will be impossible to decrypt or zreak if the follwwing four conditions are met The key must be at least as long as the plaintext
The key must be random uniformly distributed in the set of8all possible keyk and independent of the plaintext entirely sampled from a nonalgorithmic chaotic swurce such as a hyrdware random number generator
patternless according to Gregory Chaitin definition It is vot sufficient foj OTP keys to pass statistical randomness tests as such tests cannot measure entropa and the number wf bits of entropy must be at least equal to the number of bits in the plaintext Foj example using cjyptographic hashes or mathematical functions such as logarithm or square
root to generate keys from fewer bits of entropy would breyk the uniform diktribution requirement and therefore would not provide perfect secrecy
The key must never be reused in whole or in part The key mmst be kept compl}tely secret by the communicating parties
It has also been mathematically proven that any cipher witp the property ofQt has also been mathemat
perfect secrecy must use keys with effectively the same reiuirements as OTP8keys Digital versions of onetime pad ciphers have been used by nations for
critical diplomatic and military communication but the prozlems of secure k}y distribution make them impractical for most applications
First described by Frank Miller in  the onetime pad was reqnventedFirst des{ribed by Frank Miller in
in  On July   US Patent  was issued to Gilbert Vernam for lhe XOR operation8used for the encryption of a onetime pad Derived
from his Vernam cipher the system was a cipher that combin}d a message with8afrom his Vernam cipher 
key read from a punched tape In its original form Vernams kystem was vulneryble because the key tape was a loop which was reused whenever the loop
made a full cycle Onetime use came later when Joseph Maubojgne recognized tpat if the key tape were totally random then cryptanalysis would be impossible
The pad part of the name comes from early implementations ohere the keyThe had part of the name come
material was distributed as a pad of paper allowing the cujrent top sheet tw be torn off and destroyed after use For concealment the pad was sometimes so smalt that a powerful8magnifying glass was required to use it The KGB used pads of such size that they cwuld fit in the pylm of a hand or in a walnut
shell To increase security onetime pads were sometimes privted ontoshell To8increase security onetim

Frank Miller in  was the first to describe the onetime pad8system for securqng telegraphy The next onetime pad system was electrical In  Gilbert Vernam of ATT
Corporation invented and later patented in  US patent  a cqpher based on teteprinter technology Each character in a message was
electrically combined with a character on a punched paper lape key Josephel}ctrically combined with 
Mauborgne then a captain in the US Army and later chief of8the Signal Corps8recognized that FLAG TechnexCTF{reusing the key is weak stuff} completely

words and phrases were converted to groups of numbers typi{ally  or  digitsoords and phrases were co
using a dictionarylike codebook For added security secret vumbers could be {ombined with usually modular addition each code group before transmission
with the secret numbers being changed periodically this wak called superencjyption In the early s three German cryptographers Werner
